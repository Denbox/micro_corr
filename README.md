# micro_corr
web scraper and eventual debugger / disassembler to play micro corruption my way!

The microcorruption puzzles are really fun, and I want to understand what is happening at a deeper level.

This repository holds the code for this exploration.

Currently it is a web scraper that allows you to log in to microcorruption.

Later, it will ideally include a disassembler and debugger for TI MSP430x1xx processor family.
